"Munro, Alice",Friend of My Youth,Memory,Introspection,Past,First,"I used to dream about my mother and those the details in the dream varied, the surprise in it was always the same. The dream stopped, I suppose, because it was too transparent in its hopefulness, too easy it is forgiveness.",
"Munro, Alice",Five Points,Action,Lifestyle,Present,Third,"While they drink vodka and orange juice in the trailer park on the cliffs above Lake Huron, Neil Bauer tells Brenda a story. It happened a long way away, in Victoria, British Columbia, where Neil grew up. Neil is not much younger than Brenda -- less than three years -- but it sometimes feels to her like a generation gap, because she grew up here, and stayed here, marrying Cornelius Zendt when she was twenty years old, and Neil grew up on the West Coast, where things were very different, and he left home at sixteen to travel and work all over.",

"Munro, Alice",Pictures of the Ice,Action,Starts with a flash-forward,Past,Third,"Three weeks before he died -- drowned in a boating accident in a lake whose name nobody had heard him mention -- Austin Cobbett stood deep in the clasp of a three-way mirror in  Crawford's Men's Wear, in Logan, looking at himself in a burgundy sports shirt and a pair of cream, brown, and burgundy plaid pants. Both permanent press.",
"Munro, Alice",Goodness and Mercy,Action,Descriptive,Past,Third,"Bugs said so long to the disappearing land, a dark-blue finger of Labrador. The ship was passing through the Strait of Belle Isle, on its third day out from Montreal.",
"Munro, Alice","Oh, What Avails",Setting,Character quirk,Present,Third,"They are in the dining room. The varnished floor is bare except for the rug in front of the china cabinet. There is not much furniture -- a long table, some chairs, the piano, the china cabinet. On the inside of the windows, all the wooden shutters are closed. These shutters are painted a dull blue, a grayish blue. Some of the paint on them, and on the window frames, has flaked away. Some of it Joan has encouraged to flake away, using her fingernails.",
"Munro, Alice",Differently,Backstory,Metatextual,Past,Third,"George once took a creative-writing course, and what the instructor told her was: Too many things. Too many things going on at the same time; also, too many people. Think, he told her. What is the important thing? What do you want us to pay attention to? Think.",
"Munro, Alice",Wigtime,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"When her mother was dying in the Walley Hospital, Anita came home to take care of her--though nursing was not what she did anymore. She was stopped one day in the corridor by a short, broad-shouldered, broad-hipped woman with clipped grayish-brown hair.",
"Glaspell, Susan",A Jury of Her Peers,Action,Mystery,Past,Third,"When Martha Hale opened the storm-door and got a cut of the north wind, she ran back for her big woolen scarf. As she hurriedly wound that round her head her eye made a scandalized sweep of her kitchen. It was no ordinary thing that called her away -- it was probably farther from ordinary than anything that had ever happened in Dickson County. But what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving: her bread all ready for mixing, half the flour sifted and half unsifted.",
"Joyce, James",The Sisters,Action,Close third person; Interiority,Past,Third,"There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.",
"Joyce, James",An Encounter,Action,Backstory,Past,Third,"It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little
library made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
Halfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden
and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we
fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe
Dillon’s war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o’clock mass
every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon
was prevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for
us who were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an
Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head,
beating a tin with his fist and yelling:

“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!”",
"Joyce, James",Araby,Setting,N/A,Past,First,"North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the
hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An
uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from
its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street,
conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown
imperturbable faces.",
"Joyce, James",Eveline,Action,Understated,Past,Third,"She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head
was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the
odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.",
"Joyce, James",After the Race,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"The cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets
in the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore
sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward
and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its
wealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the
cheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the
blue cars—the cars of their friends, the French.",
"Joyce, James",Two Gallants,Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"The grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild
warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The streets,
shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured
crowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their
tall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue
unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging
unceasing murmur.",
"Joyce, James",The Boarding House,Character,N/A,Past,Third,"Mrs Mooney was a butcher’s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able
to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her
father’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens. But
as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the
devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no
use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few
days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by
buying bad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife
with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour’s house.",
"Joyce, James",A Little Cloud,Backstory,N/A,Past,Third,"Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and
wished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once
by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few
fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by
such success. Gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had
deserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.",
"Joyce, James",Counterparts,Dialogue,N/A,Past,Third,"The bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a
furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:

“Send Farrington here!”

Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at
a desk:

“Mr Alleyne wants you upstairs.”",
"Joyce, James",Clay,Backstory,N/A,Past,Third,"The matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women’s tea was
over and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was spick
and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper
boilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables
were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if
you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick
even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut
them herself.",
"Joyce, James",A Painful Case,Character,N/a,Past,Third,"Mr James Duffy lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as
possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found
all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived
in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the
disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin
is built. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from
pictures. He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room:
a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a
clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on
which lay a double desk. A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means
of shelves of white wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and
a black and scarlet rug covered the foot. A little hand-mirror hung
above the washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the
sole ornament of the mantelpiece. The books on the white wooden shelves
were arranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete
Wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the
_Maynooth Catechism_, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood at
one end of the top shelf. Writing materials were always on the desk. In
the desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann’s _Michael Kramer_,
the stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little
sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin. In these sheets a
sentence was inscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment,
the headline of an advertisement for _Bile Beans_ had been pasted on to
the first sheet. On lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance
escaped—the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or
of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten.",
"Joyce, James",Ivy Day in the Committee Room,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"Old Jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and
spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome
was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself
to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall
and his face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man’s face,
very bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the
moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically
when it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of
cardboard against the wall, sighed and said:

“That’s better now, Mr O’Connor.”",
"Joyce, James",A Mother,Backstory,N/A,Past,Third,"Mr Holohan, assistant secretary of the _Eire Abu_ Society, had been
walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and
pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of
concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy
Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street
corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs
Kearney who arranged everything.",
"Joyce, James",Grace,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"Two gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him
up: but he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the
stairs down which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over.
His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with
the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards.
His eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin
stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.",
"Joyce, James",The Dead,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"Lily, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly
had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office
on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the
wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the
bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not
to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought
of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’
dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and
laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the
stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask
her who had come.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Book of the Grotesque,Character,Implication,Past,Third,"The writer, an old man with a white mustache, had some difficulty in
getting into bed. The windows of the house in which he lived were high
and he wanted to look at the trees when he awoke in the morning. A
carpenter came to fix the bed so that it would be on a level with the
window.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Hands,Setting,,Past,Third,"Upon the half decayed veranda of a small frame house that stood near
the edge of a ravine near the town of Winesburg, Ohio, a fat little old
man walked nervously up and down. Across a long field that had been
seeded for clover but that had produced only a dense crop of yellow
mustard weeds, he could see the public highway along which went a wagon
filled with berry pickers returning from the fields. The berry pickers,
youths and maidens, laughed and shouted boisterously. A boy clad in a
blue shirt leaped from the wagon and attempted to drag after him one of
the maidens, who screamed and protested shrilly. The feet of the boy in
the road kicked up a cloud of dust that floated across the face of the
departing sun. Over the long field came a thin girlish voice. “Oh, you
Wing Biddlebaum, comb your hair, it’s falling into your eyes,”
commanded the voice to the man, who was bald and whose nervous little
hands fiddled about the bare white forehead as though arranging a mass
of tangled locks.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Paper Pills,Backstory,Flash-forward; time-lapse,Past,Third,"He was an old man with a white beard and huge nose and hands. Long
before the time during which we will know him, he was a doctor and
drove a jaded white horse from house to house through the streets of
Winesburg. Later he married a girl who had money. She had been left a
large fertile farm when her father died. The girl was quiet, tall, and
dark, and to many people she seemed very beautiful. Everyone in
Winesburg wondered why she married the doctor. Within a year after the
marriage she died.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Philosopher,Character,N/A,Past,Third,"Doctor Parcival was a large man with a drooping mouth covered by a
yellow mustache. He always wore a dirty white waistcoat out of the
pockets of which protruded a number of the kind of black cigars known
as stogies. His teeth were black and irregular and there was something
strange about his eyes. The lid of the left eye twitched; it fell down
and snapped up; it was exactly as though the lid of the eye were a
window shade and someone stood inside the doctor’s head playing with
the cord.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Nobody Knows,Action,N/A,Past,Third,"Looking cautiously about, George Willard arose from his desk in the
office of the _Winesburg Eagle_ and went hurriedly out at the back
door. The night was warm and cloudy and although it was not yet eight
o’clock, the alleyway back of the _Eagle_ office was pitch dark. A team
of horses tied to a post somewhere in the darkness stamped on the
hard-baked ground. A cat sprang from under George Willard’s feet and
ran away into the night. The young man was nervous. All day he had gone
about his work like one dazed by a blow. In the alleyway he trembled as
though with fright.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Godlinesss,Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"There were always three or four old people sitting on the front porch
of the house or puttering about the garden of the Bentley farm. Three
of the old people were women and sisters to Jesse. They were a
colorless, soft voiced lot. Then there was a silent old man with thin
white hair who was Jesse’s uncle.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",A Man of Ideas,Setting; Character,N/A,Past,Third,"He lived with his mother, a grey, silent woman with a peculiar ashy
complexion. The house in which they lived stood in a little grove of
trees beyond where the main street of Winesburg crossed Wine Creek. His
name was Joe Welling, and his father had been a man of some dignity in
the community, a lawyer, and a member of the state legislature at
Columbus. Joe himself was small of body and in his character unlike
anyone else in town. He was like a tiny little volcano that lies silent
for days and then suddenly spouts fire. No, he wasn’t like that—he was
like a man who is subject to fits, one who walks among his fellow men
inspiring fear because a fit may come upon him suddenly and blow him
away into a strange uncanny physical state in which his eyes roll and
his legs and arms jerk. He was like that, only that the visitation that
descended upon Joe Welling was a mental and not a physical thing. He
was beset by ideas and in the throes of one of his ideas was
uncontrollable. Words rolled and tumbled from his mouth. A peculiar
smile came upon his lips. The edges of his teeth that were tipped with
gold glistened in the light. Pouncing upon a bystander he began to
talk. For the bystander there was no escape. The excited man breathed
into his face, peered into his eyes, pounded upon his chest with a
shaking forefinger, demanded, compelled attention.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Adventure,Character,N/A,Past,Third,"Alice Hindman, a woman of twenty-seven when George Willard was a mere
boy, had lived in Winesburg all her life. She clerked in Winney’s Dry
Goods Store and lived with her mother, who had married a second
husband.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Respectability,Character,N/A,Past,Second,"If you have lived in cities and have walked in the park on a summer
afternoon, you have perhaps seen, blinking in a corner of his iron
cage, a huge, grotesque kind of monkey, a creature with ugly, sagging,
hairless skin below his eyes and a bright purple underbody. This monkey
is a true monster. In the completeness of his ugliness he achieved a
kind of perverted beauty. Children stopping before the cage are
fascinated, men turn away with an air of disgust, and women linger for
a moment, trying perhaps to remember which one of their male
acquaintances the thing in some faint way resembles.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Thinker,Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"The house in which Seth Richmond of Winesburg lived with his mother had
been at one time the show place of the town, but when young Seth lived
there its glory had become somewhat dimmed. The huge brick house which
Banker White had built on Buckeye Street had overshadowed it. The
Richmond place was in a little valley far out at the end of Main
Street. Farmers coming into town by a dusty road from the south passed
by a grove of walnut trees, skirted the Fair Ground with its high board
fence covered with advertisements, and trotted their horses down
through the valley past the Richmond place into town. As much of the
country north and south of Winesburg was devoted to fruit and berry
raising, Seth saw wagon-loads of berry pickers—boys, girls, and
women—going to the fields in the morning and returning covered with
dust in the evening. The chattering crowd, with their rude jokes cried
out from wagon to wagon, sometimes irritated him sharply. He regretted
that he also could not laugh boisterously, shout meaningless jokes and
make of himself a figure in the endless stream of moving, giggling
activity that went up and down the road.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Tandy,Backstory; Character,N/A,Past,Third,"Until she was seven years old she lived in an old unpainted house on an
unused road that led off Trunion Pike. Her father gave her but little
attention and her mother was dead. The father spent his time talking
and thinking of religion. He proclaimed himself an agnostic and was so
absorbed in destroying the ideas of God that had crept into the minds
of his neighbors that he never saw God manifesting himself in the
little child that, half forgotten, lived here and there on the bounty
of her dead mother’s relatives.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Strength of God,Character,N/A,Past,Third,"The Reverend Curtis Hartman was pastor of the Presbyterian Church of
Winesburg, and had been in that position ten years. He was forty years
old, and by his nature very silent and reticent. To preach, standing in
the pulpit before the people, was always a hardship for him and from
Wednesday morning until Saturday evening he thought of nothing but the
two sermons that must be preached on Sunday. Early on Sunday morning he
went into a little room called a study in the bell tower of the church
and prayed. In his prayers there was one note that always predominated.
“Give me strength and courage for Thy work, O Lord!” he pleaded,
kneeling on the bare floor and bowing his head in the presence of the
task that lay before him.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Teacher,Setting; Action,N/A,Past,Third,"Snow lay deep in the streets of Winesburg. It had begun to snow about
ten o’clock in the morning and a wind sprang up and blew the snow in
clouds along Main Street. The frozen mud roads that led into town were
fairly smooth and in places ice covered the mud. “There will be good
sleighing,” said Will Henderson, standing by the bar in Ed Griffith’s
saloon. Out of the saloon he went and met Sylvester West the druggist
stumbling along in the kind of heavy overshoes called arctics. “Snow
will bring the people into town on Saturday,” said the druggist. The
two men stopped and discussed their affairs. Will Henderson, who had on
a light overcoat and no overshoes, kicked the heel of his left foot
with the toe of the right. “Snow will be good for the wheat,” observed
the druggist sagely.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Loneliness,Character; Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"He was the son of Mrs. Al Robinson who once owned a farm on a side road
leading off Trunion Pike, east of Winesburg and two miles beyond the
town limits. The farmhouse was painted brown and the blinds to all of
the windows facing the road were kept closed. In the road before the
house a flock of chickens, accompanied by two guinea hens, lay in the
deep dust. Enoch lived in the house with his mother in those days and
when he was a young boy went to school at the Winesburg High School.
Old citizens remembered him as a quiet, smiling youth inclined to
silence. He walked in the middle of the road when he came into town and
sometimes read a book. Drivers of teams had to shout and swear to make
him realize where he was so that he would turn out of the beaten track
and let them pass.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",An Awakening,Character; Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"Belle Carpenter had a dark skin, grey eyes, and thick lips. She was
tall and strong. When black thoughts visited her she grew angry and
wished she were a man and could fight someone with her fists. She
worked in the millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh and during the
day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the store. She was the
daughter of Henry Carpenter, bookkeeper in the First National Bank of
Winesburg, and lived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end
of Buckeye Street. The house was surrounded by pine trees and there was
no grass beneath the trees. A rusty tin eaves-trough had slipped from
its fastenings at the back of the house and when the wind blew it beat
against the roof of a small shed, making a dismal drumming noise that
sometimes persisted all through the night.",
"Anderson, Sherwood","""Queer""",Action; Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"From his seat on a box in the rough board shed that stuck like a burr
on the rear of Cowley & Son’s store in Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the
junior member of the firm, could see through a dirty window into the
printshop of the _Winesburg Eagle_. Elmer was putting new shoelaces in
his shoes. They did not go in readily and he had to take the shoes off.
With the shoes in his hand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel
of one of his stockings. Then looking quickly up he saw George Willard,
the only newspaper reporter in Winesburg, standing at the back door of
the _Eagle_ printshop and staring absentmindedly about. “Well, well,
what next!” exclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand, jumping
to his feet and creeping away from the window.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",The Untold Lie,Backstory,N/A,Past,Third,"Ray Pearson and Hal Winters were farm hands employed on a farm three
miles north of Winesburg. On Saturday afternoons they came into town
and wandered about through the streets with other fellows from the
country.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Drink,Backstory,N/A,Past,Third,"Tom Foster came to Winesburg from Cincinnati when he was still young
and could get many new impressions. His grandmother had been raised on
a farm near the town and as a young girl had gone to school there when
Winesburg was a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered about a
general store on the Trunion Pike.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Death,Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"The stairway leading up to Doctor Reefy’s office, in the Heffner Block
above the Paris Dry Goods store, was but dimly lighted. At the head of
the stairway hung a lamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a
bracket to the wall. The lamp had a tin reflector, brown with rust and
covered with dust. The people who went up the stairway followed with
their feet the feet of many who had gone before. The soft boards of the
stairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep hollows marked
the way.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Sophistication,Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"It was early evening of a day in the late fall and the Winesburg County
Fair had brought crowds of country people into town. The day had been
clear and the night came on warm and pleasant. On the Trunion Pike,
where the road after it left town stretched away between berry fields
now covered with dry brown leaves, the dust from passing wagons arose
in clouds. Children, curled into little balls, slept on the straw
scattered on wagon beds. Their hair was full of dust and their fingers
black and sticky. The dust rolled away over the fields and the
departing sun set it ablaze with colors.",
"Anderson, Sherwood",Departure,Action; Setting,N/A,Past,Third,"Young George Willard got out of bed at four in the morning. It was
April and the young tree leaves were just coming out of their buds. The
trees along the residence streets in Winesburg are maple and the seeds
are winged. When the wind blows they whirl crazily about, filling the
air and making a carpet underfoot.",
